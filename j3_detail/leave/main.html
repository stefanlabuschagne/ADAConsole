			<p>The Vulindlela mission is to collect and manage data to deliver meaningful and integrated information to support informed decision making in Government.</p>
			<p>The Vulindlela Human Resources Application has as its objective the equipment and empowerment of Human Resources management in Government to meet annual reporting 
			requirements on issues as required by various Acts and Regulations.</p>
			<p>E.g. The Public Service Regulations, 2001 (Chapter 1, 
			Part III, Section J) administered by</SPAN><br>
			<span style="PADDING-LEFT: 29px">the Department of Public Service and Administration</span></p>
			<p>The information displayed in this application is a snapshot taken of the transactional PERSAL system, usually within the first week of a new month, and summarised 
			to levels such as RSA, Provinces, National Departments, Sectors and Components.</p>
			<p>A core value of the application lies in the identification of trends over specific time frames be it quarterly, bi-annually or yearly. It is therefore of paramount
			importance to realise that the information represented in the application will very seldom correlate with real time PERSAL transactional reports.</p>
			<p>Additional information (meta data) is provided with regards to business and transformation rules that were applied with the extraction and loading of the data.</p>
